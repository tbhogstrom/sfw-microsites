### What is Comprehensive Dry Rot Solutions?

Comprehensive Dry Rot Solutions encompass a complete assessment, repair, and prevention strategy for dry rot in homes. The process begins with a detailed inspection to assess the extent of damage. Our team then determines the best course of action, which may involve cutting back to solid wood and utilizing high-strength epoxy to repair affected areas. For severe cases, replacement of entire sections may be necessary to ensure structural integrity [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 196].
