## Service Overview

### What is Custom Wood Replacement?

Custom wood replacement involves the careful removal and replacement of damaged or rotting wood elements in your home. This process includes assessing the extent of the damage, selecting appropriate materials, and using advanced techniques to ensure a seamless fit and finish. For example, replacing rotted trim often involves cutting back to solid wood at a 45° angle and attaching new sections using durable adhesives and nails [Source: Christina Glennon - Siding, Roofing, and Trim, Page 196]. 

Our approach may also include using wood consolidants to reinforce soft, punky wood, making it as hard as rock before applying epoxy fillers for a lasting repair [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 173]. This meticulous process ensures your home remains protected from further damage while preserving its charm.
