## Service Overview

### What is Epoxy Reinforcement for Rotted Wood?

Epoxy reinforcement involves using a specially formulated two-part epoxy filler to repair and reinforce rotted wood. The process begins with an assessment of the damaged area, followed by the application of a wood hardener to stabilize the remaining structure. Once the wood is prepared, the epoxy is mixed with a thickening agent, achieving a peanut-butter-like consistency that allows for easy application. This technique ensures that the epoxy bonds well with the wood, filling any gaps and providing a robust repair that can withstand the elements [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 198].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's climate, characterized by high humidity and consistent rainfall, creates an environment conducive to wood rot. Homeowners in this region often face challenges with moisture-related decay, particularly in older homes. Epoxy reinforcement is crucial as it not only repairs existing damage but also provides a protective barrier against future rot and deterioration. By addressing rot promptly, you can avoid more extensive damage and costly repairs down the line, maintaining the safety and aesthetics of your property.
