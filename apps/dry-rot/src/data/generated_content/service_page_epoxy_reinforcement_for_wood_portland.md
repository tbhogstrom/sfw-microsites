## Service Overview

### What is Epoxy Reinforcement for Wood?

Epoxy reinforcement for wood involves the use of high-strength two-part epoxy fillers to repair and fortify damaged wooden structures. The process begins with assessing the extent of damage, followed by cleaning and preparing the affected areas. A wood hardener is then applied to stabilize the damaged wood, ensuring that the epoxy adheres effectively. The epoxy is mixed to a peanut-butter-like consistency, allowing for easy application and maximum penetration into damaged areas [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 198].

By using a combination of wood consolidants and epoxy fillers, we can restore the structural integrity of your wood while also preparing it for a protective coat of paint or finish [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 173].
