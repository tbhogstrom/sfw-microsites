## Service Overview

### What is Lead Paint Testing in Portland?

Lead paint testing involves a thorough assessment of your home to detect the presence of lead-based paint. Our certified professionals use EPA-approved testing kits, such as LeadCheck swabs, to sample paint surfaces. This process includes cutting into layers of paint to check for lead content and assessing various surfaces in your home, including door casings, window frames, and siding [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 53]. If lead is detected, we provide detailed recommendations for safe removal and abatement, adhering to guidelines set by the EPA.
