## Service Overview

### What is Chemical Lead Paint Removal?

Chemical lead paint removal involves the use of specially formulated chemical strippers to safely and effectively remove lead-based paint from surfaces. These strippers are applied to the painted areas and allowed to penetrate the paint layer. After a specified time, the paint begins to blister, allowing for gentle scraping without damaging the underlying wood [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 66]. This method is particularly effective in intricate areas where mechanical scrapers may not reach and minimizes the risk of lead dust becoming airborne.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Given Seattle’s historical architecture and the prevalence of homes built before 1978, many residences may still harbor lead paint. The mild, moist climate can exacerbate paint deterioration, increasing the risk of lead exposure. Regular maintenance and safe removal of lead paint are crucial for homeowners to mitigate health risks and comply with local regulations.
