## Service Overview

### What is Heat Gun Lead Paint Removal?

Heat gun lead paint removal is a specialized technique that uses controlled heat to loosen lead-based paint from surfaces such as wood, plaster, and metal. This method involves directing heat to the paint, causing it to bubble and separate from the substrate, making it easier to scrape away without creating dust or debris. However, caution must be exercised as improper use of heat guns can produce hazardous fumes and pose fire risks, especially in homes with lead paint. Therefore, our trained professionals follow strict safety protocols to mitigate these risks, including using respirators and monitoring for lead contamination [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 525].
