### What is Lead Paint Encapsulation?

Lead paint encapsulation is a method where a specialized coating is applied over existing lead-based paint surfaces. This encapsulation creates a barrier that prevents the lead paint from deteriorating and releasing toxic dust and chips into the air. The process involves careful surface preparation, including cleaning and possibly sanding the existing paint to ensure proper adhesion of the encapsulant. This technique is particularly useful for intricate details and tight spaces where traditional removal methods may be less effective [Source: Christina Glennon - Siding, Roofing, and Trim, Page 66].
