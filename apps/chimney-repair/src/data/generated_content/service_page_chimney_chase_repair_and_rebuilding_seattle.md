## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Chase Repair and Rebuilding?

Chimney chase repair and rebuilding involves restoring or replacing the exterior structure that surrounds your chimney, commonly referred to as the chimney chase. This structure is critical in protecting the flue from the elements and maintaining the integrity of the chimney system. Over time, due to weather exposure and wear, the chase may develop issues such as cracked mortar, water leaks, or deterioration of materials.

Our repair process may include sealing gaps with urethane sealant, rebuilding parts of the chase, or installing a new cap to prevent water intrusion [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 237]. Depending on the extent of damage, we may also recommend relining the chimney flue or installing a new stainless-steel or masonry liner to enhance functionality and safety [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 8].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's unique climate—characterized by high levels of precipitation and humidity—makes chimney chase maintenance vital. The constant exposure to rain can lead to water infiltrating the chimney chase, which may cause significant damage if left unaddressed. Building codes in Seattle also mandate proper chimney construction and maintenance to ensure safety and compliance [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 21]. 

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Cracked or Deteriorating Mortar**: This can lead to water penetration and structural weakening [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 21].
- **Water Damage**: A compromised chase can allow moisture to enter, leading to mold and rot [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 22].
- **Chimney Fires**: Insufficient lining or damaged flue tiles can cause superheated gases to escape, posing fire risks [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 9].
