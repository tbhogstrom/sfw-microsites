## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Flashing Repair?

Chimney flashing repair involves assessing and fixing the metal flashing around your chimney that is designed to prevent water leakage. This process includes the installation of step flashing, counterflashing, and apron flashing, which work together to create a watertight seal. Step flashing is interwoven with roof shingles, while counterflashing is set into the mortar of the chimney to create a secondary defense against water intrusion [Source: Glennon, Page 182]. 

When flashing fails, it can lead to issues such as rotting wood and mold growth, as water seeps into vulnerable areas around the chimney [Source: Glennon, Page 180]. Our experienced team uses high-quality materials, such as copper flashing, which is more durable than aluminum and offers superior protection against the elements [Source: Glennon, Page 181].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's climate is characterized by heavy rainfall and moisture, making chimney flashing repair especially vital. The potential for leaks increases significantly if your flashing is damaged or improperly installed.
