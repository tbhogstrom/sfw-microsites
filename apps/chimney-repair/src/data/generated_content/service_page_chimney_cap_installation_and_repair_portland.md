## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Cap Installation and Repair?

Chimney cap installation involves placing a protective cap on top of the chimney to shield it from adverse weather conditions and other potential hazards. A well-constructed chimney cap can include features such as a sloping design to shed water away from the chimney structure, as well as a mesh screen to prevent animals from entering [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 236]. Repairs may involve fixing or replacing damaged caps, ensuring they are securely attached, and sealing any gaps to maintain their integrity.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

The climate in Portland features a significant amount of rainfall and occasional snow, making chimney caps particularly vital. A functional chimney cap helps to prevent water from pooling inside the chimney, which can lead to deteriorating mortar joints and even the need for a complete chimney rebuild if left unchecked [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 21]. Additionally, local building codes may require certain specifications for chimney caps, making professional installation an important consideration for compliance.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Water Damage**: Poorly maintained or absent chimney caps can lead to water infiltration, causing structural damage to the chimney and surrounding areas [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 21].
- **Blockages**: Debris accumulation from trees and wind can obstruct the flue, leading to smoke backdrafts and increasing the risk of chimney fires [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 21].
- **Animal Intrusion**: Without a proper cap, animals can enter the chimney, creating blockages and potential fire hazards [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 21].
- **Inefficient Draft**: A damaged or improperly installed cap can disrupt airflow, leading to inefficient fireplace operation and increased smoke production [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 21].
