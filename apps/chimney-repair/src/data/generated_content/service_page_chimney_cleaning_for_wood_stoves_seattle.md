## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Cleaning for Wood Stoves?

Chimney cleaning for wood stoves involves a thorough inspection and cleaning of your chimney flue to remove hazardous creosote, soot, and other debris. Our process begins with an initial assessment of your chimney's condition. We use specialized brushes made from polypropylene or stiff steel-wire to scrub the flue surfaces without causing damage [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 235]. This ensures that any creosote buildup is effectively removed, significantly reducing the risk of chimney fires.

In addition to cleaning, we perform a visual inspection of the chimney and flue linings. This includes the use of technology such as video cameras to identify any structural issues, such as cracked tiles or damaged mortar joints, which could compromise safety and performance [Source: Michael Litchfield, Page 235]. 

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's unique climate, characterized by cool, wet winters, increases the risk of creosote accumulation in chimneys. Homeowners often use their wood stoves more frequently during the colder months, making regular chimney cleaning essential to prevent fires and ensure optimal operation. Local building codes typically require annual inspections and cleanings before the heating season begins, making our services not only a proactive measure but also a compliance necessity.
