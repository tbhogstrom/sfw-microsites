## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Chase Crown Repair?

Chimney chase crown repair involves the restoration or replacement of the chimney crown, a critical component that directs rainwater away from the chimney structure. In Seattle, where heavy rainfall is common, the crown must be adequately sloped and constructed from durable materials to prevent water pooling, which can lead to severe deterioration of the chimney's masonry.

If your chimney crown is cracked or missing, water can infiltrate the flue tiles, causing them to deteriorate. Our process includes assessing the condition of the existing crown, determining whether a repair or complete replacement is necessary, and then executing the repairs using high-quality materials [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation-Taunton Press, 2013, Page 236].
