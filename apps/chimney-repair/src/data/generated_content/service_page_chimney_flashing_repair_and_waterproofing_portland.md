## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Flashing Repair and Waterproofing?

Chimney flashing repair involves the inspection, replacement, and waterproofing of the flashing around your chimney. Flashing is typically made of metal and is installed to direct water away from the chimney and roof junction, preventing water intrusion. Our process includes a thorough assessment of the existing flashing, identifying any signs of wear, corrosion, or improper installation [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 180].

In our waterproofing process, we ensure that all seams and joints are properly sealed using high-quality materials. This includes the use of copper flashing, which is superior to aluminum due to its durability and resistance to corrosion [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 181]. We also apply a mineral-surfaced underlayment beneath the shingles, providing an additional layer of defense against water intrusion [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 181].
