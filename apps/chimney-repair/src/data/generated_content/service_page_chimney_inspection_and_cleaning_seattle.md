### What is Chimney Inspection and Cleaning?

Chimney inspection and cleaning involve a detailed assessment and maintenance of your chimney system. This includes examining the flue for creosote buildup, checking the integrity of the flue tiles, and inspecting the chimney crown and mortar joints. According to industry standards, chimneys should be inspected at least once a year and cleaned as needed, ideally before the heating season. This service typically involves:

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's wet climate can lead to increased moisture in chimneys, which can accelerate deterioration. This region is prone to issues like creosote buildup due to the burning of unseasoned wood, which can lead to chimney fires. Local building codes may also require specific maintenance standards, making it crucial for homeowners to stay compliant. Regular inspections not only enhance safety but also ensure that your chimney adheres to local regulations.
