## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Crown Repair?

Chimney crown repair involves the restoration or replacement of the top section of your chimney, designed to shed water away from the brick and mortar structure. This is crucial because the crown prevents rain and snow from penetrating the chimney and causing damage to the inner flue and surrounding masonry. Depending on the condition of your existing crown, our skilled technicians can either repair cracks and imperfections or construct a new crown using durable materials such as concrete or mortar. According to best practices, a concrete crown should overhang the chimney by at least 1 to 1.5 inches to effectively serve as a drip cap [Source: Renovation, Page 236].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Given Seattle's climate, which features significant rainfall and occasional snowfall, maintaining a durable chimney crown is essential. Water can seep into cracks in the crown, leading to extensive damage that may require costly repairs or even replacement of the chimney structure. Local building codes also emphasize the importance of proper chimney design and maintenance to ensure safety and compliance [Source: Renovation, Page 21].
