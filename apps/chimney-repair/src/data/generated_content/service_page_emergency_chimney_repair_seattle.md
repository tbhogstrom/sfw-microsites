### What is Emergency Chimney Repair?

Emergency chimney repair involves addressing urgent repairs needed to ensure the safe operation of your chimney system. This can include repairing or replacing damaged mortar joints, flue tiles, chimney caps, and flashing that may lead to leaks and structural damage.
