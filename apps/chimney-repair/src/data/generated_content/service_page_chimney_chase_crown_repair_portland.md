## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Chase Crown Repair?

Chimney chase crown repair involves repairing or replacing the crown at the top of your chimney, which is designed to direct water away, preventing it from seeping into the chimney structure. There are generally two types of crowns: concrete crowns that overhang the chimney and sloping mortar crowns. The former is more durable and suitable for areas with heavy precipitation, while the latter is easier and quicker to construct but may not provide the same level of protection [Source: Litchfield, Page 236].

During the repair process, our team will assess the existing crown for damage, clean the chimney, and use high-quality materials to ensure a long-lasting repair. If needed, we may install a new concrete crown that extends at least 1 to 1.5 inches over the chimney to act as a drip cap [Source: Litchfield, Page 237].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland’s rainy climate can lead to significant wear and tear on chimney crowns. Frequent precipitation increases the likelihood of water penetrating the crown and eroding mortar joints. Without proper maintenance and repair, this can result in severe structural damage to your chimney and potentially your home. Understanding local building codes and regulations can also ensure that your chimney remains compliant and safe for use [Source: Litchfield, Page 21].

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Cracked or Missing Crown**: A compromised crown allows water to seep into the chimney, leading to deterioration [Source: Litchfield, Page 236].
- **Eroded Mortar Joints**: Over time, exposure to moisture can cause mortar joints to crumble, necessitating repointing or rebuilding [Source: Litchfield, Page 21].
- **Water Penetration**: Insufficient drainage from the crown leads to water pooling and damage inside the chimney structure [Source: Litchfield, Page 236].
- **Inadequate Draft**: A poorly constructed or damaged crown can affect the chimney’s ability to vent properly, risking smoke and gases entering the home [Source: Litchfield, Page 9].
