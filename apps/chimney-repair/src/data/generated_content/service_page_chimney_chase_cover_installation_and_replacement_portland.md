## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Chase Cover Installation and Replacement?

Chimney chase cover installation involves placing a metal cover over the top of the chimney chase, which is the vertical structure that encloses the flue pipe. These covers are typically made from stainless steel or copper, chosen for their durability and resistance to rust and corrosion. Proper installation requires careful measurement and secure fitting to ensure a watertight seal, which is critical in preventing water intrusion and protecting the chimney interior from the elements [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 236].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Additionally, local building codes often mandate that chimneys be correctly capped to prevent hazards, making professional installation essential.
