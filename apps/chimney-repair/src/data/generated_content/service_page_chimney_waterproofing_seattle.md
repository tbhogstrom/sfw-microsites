## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Waterproofing?

Chimney waterproofing involves applying a specialized sealant designed to repel water while allowing moisture vapor to escape. This process typically includes the inspection of mortar joints and flue liners, ensuring they are intact and free from cracks. If any issues are identified, such as missing or broken flue tiles, they are addressed prior to waterproofing. By sealing the chimney effectively, we can prevent moisture from penetrating the masonry, which can lead to a host of other problems, including efflorescence, crumbling mortar, and even structural damage [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 234].
