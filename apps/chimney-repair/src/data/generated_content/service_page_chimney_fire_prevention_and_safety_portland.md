## Service Overview

### What is Chimney Fire Prevention and Safety?

Chimney fire prevention and safety involve a comprehensive approach to maintaining your chimney's integrity and functionality. This includes annual inspections, cleaning, and repairs as needed. During an inspection, our experts will examine the chimney structure, flue linings, and mortar joints to identify any cracks or deterioration that could allow superheated gases to escape and ignite surrounding materials [Source: Litchfield, Page 235]. We also offer video inspections to provide you with a visual understanding of any issues within your chimney.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's unique climate, with its wet winters and dry summers, creates specific challenges for chimney maintenance. The potential for creosote buildup increases with the use of unseasoned wood, leading to dangerous chimney fires [Source: Litchfield, Page 235]. Local building codes also necessitate regular inspections to ensure your chimney complies with safety regulations, making our services essential for homeowners who wish to protect their investments.

### Common Problems This Service Solves

- **Obstructions**: Nests and debris can block airflow, leading to inefficient burning and increased smoke [Source: Litchfield, Page 239].
