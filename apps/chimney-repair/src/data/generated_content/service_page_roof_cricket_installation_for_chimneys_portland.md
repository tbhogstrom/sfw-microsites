### Protect Your Home with Professional Roof Cricket Installation

When it comes to maintaining the integrity of your home, proper roof cricket installation for chimneys is essential. A roof cricket, often referred to as a chimney saddle, is a sloped structure designed to divert water away from your chimney.

## Service Overview

### What is Roof Cricket Installation for Chimneys?

Roof cricket installation involves the construction of a sloped surface that directs water around the chimney rather than allowing it to pool at its base. This structure is typically made from materials like galvanized steel or durable roofing membranes, ensuring longevity and effectiveness. The cricket must be carefully integrated with the existing roofing system, incorporating step-flashing and counterflashing to ensure a watertight seal [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 98].

The cricket should extend at least 6 inches under the shingles above it and be constructed at an appropriate angle to facilitate optimal water flow [Source: Christina Glennon, Siding, Roofing, and Trim, Page 183]. Attention to these details is crucial to prevent leaks and ensure the longevity of both the chimney and roofing system.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's climate is characterized by heavy rainfall, particularly in the fall and winter months. This weather pattern increases the likelihood of water pooling around chimneys, leading to potential leaks and significant water damage. Installing a roof cricket is vital for preventing these issues, as it effectively redirects water and snow away from the chimney, safeguarding your home’s structural integrity.

Moreover, local building codes often require proper drainage solutions for chimney installations. Failing to adhere to these regulations may result in costly fines or the need for costly retrofits [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 21].

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Water Pooling**: Without a cricket, water can accumulate at the base of the chimney, leading to leaks and water damage [Source: Christina Glennon, Siding, Roofing, and Trim, Page 183].
- **Chimney Damage**: A poorly managed chimney can suffer from erosion and structural issues over time due to prolonged exposure to water [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 236].
- **Mold Growth**: Stagnant water around chimneys can promote mold growth, affecting indoor air quality and potentially causing health issues [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 98].
- **Increased Maintenance Costs**: Regular repairs due to water damage can add up quickly; a cricket installation minimizes these risks and associated costs [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 97].
