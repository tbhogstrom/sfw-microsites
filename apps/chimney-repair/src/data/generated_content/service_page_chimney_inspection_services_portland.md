### What is Chimney Inspection Services?

Chimney inspection services encompass a comprehensive evaluation of your chimney's condition. Our trained technicians will assess both the exterior and interior components, looking for signs of wear and damage. These inspections typically include:

- **Visual Inspection**: We conduct a thorough examination of the chimney structure, including the mortar joints and crown, to identify any visible damage or wear [Source: Litchfield, Page 21].
- **Flue Examination**: We utilize advanced tools, including video cameras, to inspect the flue lining for cracks and creosote build-up, ensuring gases are vented safely [Source: Litchfield, Page 235].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's unique climate, characterized by high rainfall and humidity, can significantly impact your chimney's integrity. Moisture can lead to creosote accumulation and accelerate the deterioration of chimney components. Additionally, local building codes often mandate annual inspections for homes with wood-burning appliances. Having a professional chimney inspection service ensures compliance with these regulations while safeguarding your home against potential hazards.
