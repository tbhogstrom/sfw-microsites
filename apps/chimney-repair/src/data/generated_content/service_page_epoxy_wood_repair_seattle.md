## Our Process
### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initial Assessment**: Our team conducts a detailed inspection of the affected areas to identify the extent of the damage and determine the best repair strategy.
   
2. **Planning & Preparation**: We develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your specific needs, preparing the worksite by clearing debris and ensuring a clean mixing area for the epoxy [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 198].

3. **Execution**: The damaged wood is treated with a consolidant to strengthen it. Once the area is prepared, we mix the epoxy with a thickening agent to achieve a peanut-butter-like consistency, allowing for easy application and shaping [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 196].

4. **Quality Check & Cleanup**: After applying the epoxy, we monitor its curing process to ensure optimal bonding. Once cured, we sand and finish the repair to match the surrounding wood seamlessly.
