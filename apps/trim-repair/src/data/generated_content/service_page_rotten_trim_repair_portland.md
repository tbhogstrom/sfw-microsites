## Service Overview

### What is Rotten Trim Repair?

Rotten trim repair involves the assessment, removal, and replacement or reinforcement of damaged trim sections. Our process begins with a thorough inspection to determine the extent of the damage. If the trim is salvageable, we often implement techniques such as cutting back to sound wood and applying high-strength marine epoxy for repairs [Source: Christina Glennon - Siding, Roofing, and Trim, Page 197]. This ensures a seamless and durable finish. If the trim is beyond repair, we replace it with new, high-quality materials that match the original for aesthetic continuity.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's unique climate—characterized by dampness and occasional heavy rainfall—creates an environment where wood trim is particularly susceptible to rot. Additionally, the local building codes may mandate specific types of materials or methods for repairs. Proper maintenance of your trim is vital to preserving your home’s structure and ensuring compliance with local standards.
