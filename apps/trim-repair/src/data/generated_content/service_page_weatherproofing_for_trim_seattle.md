## Service Overview

### What is Weatherproofing for Trim?

Weatherproofing for trim is a multi-step process designed to protect exterior trim from the harsh climatic conditions often experienced in Seattle. This service typically includes:

1. **Priming**: All sides and edges of the trim are primed to prevent moisture absorption and to ensure paint adheres correctly [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].
2. **Sealing Cut Edges**: After trimming, the exposed ends are sealed immediately to prevent moisture infiltration, which can lead to rot [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].
3. **Painting**: At least two coats of high-quality acrylic latex paint are applied after priming to complete the waterproof barrier [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].
4. **Installation**: Trim is secured to the framing rather than just sheathing to enhance stability and durability [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle’s Pacific Northwest climate features significant rainfall and varying temperatures, making proper weatherproofing essential. The moisture can lead to serious issues such as wood rot, mold, and paint failure if not adequately addressed. Following local building codes regarding moisture control is crucial to avoid long-term damage to your home. 

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Wood Rot**: Exposure to moisture can cause wood trim to decay. Weatherproofing significantly reduces this risk by sealing wood surfaces [Source: Litchfield, Page 168].
- **Paint Peeling**: Unprotected trim can lead to paint failure. Proper sealing and priming prevent water from penetrating the wood, maintaining a beautiful finish [Source: Glennon, Page 83].
- **Mold Growth**: Moisture trapped in unsealed trim can lead to mold—a health hazard. Weatherproofing eliminates this problem by providing a moisture barrier [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].
- **Cupping and Warping**: If moisture enters cut edges of the trim, it can cause warping. Sealing these edges prevents this issue [Source: Litchfield, Page 169].
