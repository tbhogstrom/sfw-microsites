## Service Overview

### What is Energy-Efficient Window Replacement?

Energy-efficient window replacement involves the installation of windows designed to minimize energy loss, enhance thermal insulation, and reduce overall energy consumption. These windows often feature advanced glazing technologies, such as low-emissivity (low-E) coatings, gas fills between panes for better insulation, and thermally broken frames that prevent heat transfer [Source: Wing, Page 305].
