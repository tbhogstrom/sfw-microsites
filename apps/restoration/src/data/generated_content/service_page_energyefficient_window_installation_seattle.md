## Service Overview

### What is Energy-Efficient Window Installation?

Energy-efficient window installation involves replacing old, inefficient windows with new, high-performance models designed to minimize heat transfer and reduce energy consumption. This service typically includes the installation of double or triple-glazed windows with low-emissivity (low-e) coatings that enhance insulation properties [Source: Litchfield, Page 146]. These windows are constructed with advanced materials and technologies that provide superior thermal performance, ultimately leading to significant long-term savings on energy bills.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle’s climate, characterized by cool, damp winters and mild summers, necessitates a specific approach to window installation. Energy-efficient windows can help combat the cold drafts that are prevalent in older homes and reduce the energy required for heating during the winter months. Additionally, as part of local building codes, energy-efficient windows are often required in new constructions and major renovations, making this upgrade not just beneficial but necessary for homeowners in the Seattle area.
