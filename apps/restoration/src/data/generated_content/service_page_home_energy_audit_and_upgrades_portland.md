## Service Overview

### What is Home Energy Audit and Upgrades?

A home energy audit is a thorough assessment of your home’s energy use and efficiency. This process involves a detailed examination of various elements, including insulation, windows, doors, heating and cooling systems, and appliances. The auditor uses specialized tools and techniques, such as combustion analyzers and electricity monitors, to identify areas where energy is wasted. A report is generated that includes an energy-efficiency rating, recommendations for improvements, and potential savings based on upgrades [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 401].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's climate, characterized by wet winters and mild summers, can exacerbate energy inefficiencies in homes. Many older homes in the area suffer from air infiltration, particularly in attics and crawl spaces, resulting in higher heating and cooling costs [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 397]. Local building codes are increasingly mandating energy audits for significant renovations, making this service not just beneficial but essential for compliance and improved home performance.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Air Leakage**: Old homes often have significant air leaks, allowing conditioned air to escape and unconditioned air to enter, leading to uncomfortable temperatures and higher energy bills [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 401].
- **Inefficient Appliances**: Many households use outdated appliances that consume excessive energy, particularly in the kitchen, which accounts for nearly 30% of utility bills [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 401].
- **Poor Insulation**: Insufficient insulation can lead to major heat loss, especially in attics and crawl spaces, resulting in inefficient heating and cooling systems [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 397].
- **Combustion Safety Issues**: Gas appliances can pose safety risks if not properly maintained. An energy audit includes checks for gas leaks and efficiency, ensuring your home is safe [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 401].
