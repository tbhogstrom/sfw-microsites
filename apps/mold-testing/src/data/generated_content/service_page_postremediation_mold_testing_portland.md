## Service Overview

### What is Post-Remediation Mold Testing?

Post-remediation mold testing involves a series of assessments performed after a mold remediation process to ensure that all mold and moisture issues have been effectively addressed. Our process begins with an initial assessment to evaluate the work done during remediation. We then perform air quality tests and surface sampling to detect any remaining mold spores, ensuring they fall below acceptable levels. If necessary, we also check for moisture content in building materials, as moisture is a key contributor to mold growth. According to building standards, moisture content in framing should be between 15% to 20% or less for optimal conditions [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 415].
