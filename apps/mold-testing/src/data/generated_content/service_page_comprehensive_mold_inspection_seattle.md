## Service Overview

### What is Comprehensive Mold Inspection?

Our **Comprehensive Mold Inspection** involves a detailed assessment of your property to identify existing mold and conditions conducive to its growth. Using advanced techniques and equipment, our trained professionals assess all areas of your home, including behind walls and under flooring, where mold often lurks undetected. 

The process begins with a visual inspection, followed by moisture readings using specialized equipment. If mold is suspected, samples may be collected for laboratory analysis.
