## Service Overview

### What is Crawlspace Ventilation Improvement?

Crawlspace ventilation improvement involves a series of strategic measures designed to enhance air circulation in your crawlspace. This process may include the installation of vents, sealing of gaps, and the application of vapor barriers to prevent moisture buildup. According to building codes, unconditioned crawlspaces must have sufficient ventilation to reduce humidity levels and prevent mold growth. The International Residential Code (IRC) requires proper vent sizing to ensure adequate airflow, typically needing a minimum vent area of 1 square foot for every 150 square feet of crawlspace floor area [Source: Charlie Wing, Page 108].

These conditions can lead to moisture accumulation, causing mold and structural damage. Additionally, local building codes mandate that crawlspaces be appropriately ventilated to prevent such issues. By investing in crawlspace ventilation improvement, homeowners can maintain a safe, healthy environment and comply with local regulations.
