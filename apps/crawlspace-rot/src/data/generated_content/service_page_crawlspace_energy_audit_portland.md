## Service Overview

### What is Crawlspace Energy Audit?

A crawlspace energy audit is a systematic evaluation of your home's crawlspace to assess its energy efficiency and identify any underlying issues. This audit involves inspecting insulation levels, ventilation systems, moisture barriers, and potential sources of air leakage. 

During the audit, our trained professionals will use specialized equipment to measure humidity levels and check for mold, rot, or pest infestations. We’ll also ensure that your crawlspace is compliant with local building codes and best practices for insulation and moisture control. This process helps to create a continuous moisture barrier, essential for preventing mold and wood rot [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 414].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

In Portland, the damp climate can lead to significant moisture accumulation in crawlspaces, creating a breeding ground for mold and fungi. This not only affects your home's structural integrity but can also lead to health issues related to poor indoor air quality. Moreover, many homes in the area were built before modern energy efficiency standards were established, making an energy audit critical for identifying and rectifying inefficiencies.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Moisture Intrusion**: Excess water can lead to mold growth, which thrives in humid environments. Maintaining proper moisture levels is crucial [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 214].
- **Improper Insulation**: Insufficient insulation can cause significant energy loss. An energy audit will identify if your crawlspace lacks the necessary insulation [Source: Charlie Wing - The Visual Handbook, Page 463].
- **Poor Ventilation**: If the crawlspace is not properly ventilated, it can trap moisture and promote mold growth. The IRC recommends proper ventilation to prevent moisture buildup [Source: Charlie Wing - The Visual Handbook, Page 108].
- **Structural Issues**: Leaks and water damage can lead to wood rot, which compromises the structural integrity of your home. Our audit will help identify any such risks [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 214].
