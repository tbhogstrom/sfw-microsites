## Service Overview

### What is I-Beam Installation and Repair Services in Portland, OR?

I-beam installation and repair involve the strategic placement and support of steel I-beams within a structure to enhance its load-bearing capacity. The process includes careful assessment, planning, and execution to replace or install beams that support various loads, whether from floors, roofs, or walls. For instance, when replacing a wooden girder with a steel I-beam, it is crucial to transfer the existing load correctly to avoid structural issues. This process often involves the use of shoring and hydraulic jacks to safely place the I-beam into position [Source: Litchfield, Page 255].
