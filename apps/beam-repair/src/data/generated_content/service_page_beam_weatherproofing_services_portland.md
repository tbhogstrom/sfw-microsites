## Service Overview

### What is Beam Weatherproofing Services?

Beam weatherproofing involves applying protective membranes and materials to safeguard your structural beams from moisture, rot, and insect damage. This process typically includes the installation of self-adhering waterproof membranes around the beams, sealing joints, and ensuring that any penetrations through the beam structure are adequately flashed. According to industry standards, using products like WSU (Waterproofing Self-Adhering Underlayment) provides a reliable barrier against water intrusion, as it self-seals around nails and other fasteners, ensuring a truly waterproof installation [Source: Litchfield, Page 93].
