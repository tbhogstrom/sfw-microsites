## Service Overview

### What is Beam Inspection and Assessment?

Beam inspection and assessment involve a detailed evaluation of the structural beams within your home, focusing on factors like integrity, load-bearing capacity, and potential damage. Our team examines the condition of both exposed and hidden beams, checking for signs of deterioration, such as rot, rust, or cracks. This process may include the use of specialized tools to measure the load-bearing capacity and to ensure that beams are properly anchored and supported. As highlighted in construction handbooks, understanding the structural components—like the installation of I-beams and shoring posts—is critical for effective repairs ([Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 252]).
