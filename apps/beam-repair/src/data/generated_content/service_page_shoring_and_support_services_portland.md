## Service Overview

### What is Shoring and Support Services?

Shoring and support services involve the use of temporary structures to support a building or structure during repairs or modifications. This may include installing shoring posts, braces, and hydraulic jacks to stabilize load-bearing beams and walls [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 252]. The process begins with a thorough assessment of the existing structure to determine the necessary supports. Once identified, the shoring system is carefully installed to ensure that all loads are adequately supported, allowing for safe construction practices.

Shoring can be particularly complex, often requiring the use of hydraulic jacks and other specialized equipment to raise beams and walls to their proper height. Additionally, cross bracing techniques and post caps are utilized to maintain the stability of the shoring system as work is performed [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 256].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

In Portland, homeowners face unique challenges due to the region's wet climate and seismic activity. The importance of proper shoring cannot be overstated, as inadequate support during construction can lead to severe structural failures. Local building codes necessitate strict adherence to safety protocols, and ensuring that your home is supported correctly during renovations or repairs is crucial to avoiding costly damage or potential injury.
