## Service Overview

### What is Beam Replacement Services?

Beam replacement involves the careful removal of old, damaged beams and the installation of new, structurally sound beams. This process typically includes assessing the existing structure, shoring up the area, and securely installing new beams to transfer loads effectively. Our techniques are based on industry standards and best practices, ensuring that every job is performed safely and efficiently. 

During the replacement process, we utilize shoring posts to support the structure while the old beams are removed and the new ones are installed. This method includes cutting precise lengths for shoring posts and using hydraulic jacks to raise and secure the beams in place, maintaining a stable work environment throughout the project ([Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 252]).
