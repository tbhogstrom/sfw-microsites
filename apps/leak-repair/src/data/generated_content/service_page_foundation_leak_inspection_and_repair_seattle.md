## Service Overview

### What is Foundation Leak Inspection and Repair?

Foundation leak inspection and repair involves a thorough assessment of your foundation to identify any leaks or vulnerabilities that may allow water to seep into your home. During the inspection, our experts will examine the foundation walls, basement, and surrounding drainage systems. We utilize modern tools and techniques, such as moisture meters and thermal imaging, to detect hidden leaks and assess their severity.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle’s climate, characterized by its wet winters and occasional dry spells, poses a significant threat to home foundations. The region’s soil conditions can lead to water accumulation around foundations, and without proper drainage, this can result in leaks and structural damage. Building codes in Seattle also mandate proper drainage systems to mitigate water flow around foundations, making timely inspection and repair crucial for compliance and safety [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 255].
