## Service Overview

### What is Slab Leak Detection and Repair?

Slab leak detection and repair involves identifying and fixing leaks that occur in the plumbing lines beneath the concrete slab of your home. These leaks can be caused by a variety of issues, including shifting soil, aging pipes, or improper installation. Utilizing methods such as acoustic listening devices, infrared technology, and pressure testing, we can accurately locate the source of the leak without invasive measures. Once identified, repairs can be made using techniques such as epoxy injection or pipe rerouting, ensuring the integrity of your home’s slab foundations [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 245].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

In Portland, where the weather can be unpredictable and often wet, the risk of slab leaks increases significantly. The city's unique soil conditions can contribute to foundation settling, making it crucial for homeowners to stay vigilant about potential leaks. Additionally, Portland's building codes require that homes have adequate drainage systems to mitigate risks associated with moisture and flooding. Regular slab leak detection not only adheres to these regulations but also protects your investment from the long-term effects of water damage.
