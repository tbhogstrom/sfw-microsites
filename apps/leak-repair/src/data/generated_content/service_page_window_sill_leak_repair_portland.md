## Service Overview

### What is Window Sill Leak Repair?

Window sill leak repair involves diagnosing, repairing, and preventing leaks around your window sills. The process begins with a thorough inspection of the window area to identify the source of the leak, which often involves checking the sill, frame, and surrounding materials. 

Once identified, we apply self-adhesive flashing tape to create a watertight seal and may also install a sill pan to direct any water away from the window and into appropriate drainage channels [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 140]. This prevents water from accumulating and causing damage to the interior of your home.
