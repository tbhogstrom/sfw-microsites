## Service Overview

### What is Duct Leakage Testing and Sealing?

Duct leakage testing and sealing involves a comprehensive assessment of your home's ductwork to identify and seal leaks that compromise energy efficiency. Our process begins with an initial assessment using a duct blower, which pressurizes the system to reveal leaks. This testing can highlight issues such as air escaping from connections, end caps, and faulty seals, which can account for up to 30% of energy loss in a home [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 399]. 

Once leaks are identified, we use high-quality materials like UL-181-approved foil tape and fiber-reinforced mastic to seal joints and connections effectively. This sealing not only prevents air loss but also helps maintain optimal indoor air quality by preventing outside contaminants from entering the living space [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 406].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

In Seattle, where the climate can be both damp and chilly, effective duct sealing is paramount. With the potential for high humidity levels, leaky ducts can lead to increased moisture in your home, promoting mold growth and adversely affecting indoor air quality. Moreover, energy costs can escalate quickly in this region due to inefficient heating and cooling systems operating at less than optimal performance.

Local building codes often require energy-efficient practices, making duct sealing not just a smart choice but sometimes a necessary one for compliance. By investing in duct leakage testing and sealing, Seattle homeowners can ensure that their homes are both comfortable and energy-efficient.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **High Utility Bills**: Unsealed ducts can lead to significant energy loss, increasing heating and cooling costs [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 399].
- **Poor Indoor Air Quality**: Leaky ducts can draw in pollutants and allergens from unconditioned spaces, affecting your health and comfort [Source: Charlie Wing, The Visual Handbook of Building and Remodeling, Page 489].
- **Uncomfortable Living Spaces**: Inconsistent temperatures throughout your home can create hot and cold spots, making it difficult to maintain comfort levels [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 399].
- **Potential Safety Hazards**: Duct leaks near combustion appliances can create negative pressure, drawing harmful gases back into your living spaces [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 399].
