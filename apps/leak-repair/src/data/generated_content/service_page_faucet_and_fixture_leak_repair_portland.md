## Service Overview

### What is Faucet and Fixture Leak Repair?

Faucet and fixture leak repair involves identifying, diagnosing, and rectifying leaks in various plumbing fixtures, including sinks, faucets, and showers. Our technicians perform a thorough assessment to determine the source of the leak, which could be due to worn-out seals, corrosion, or improper installation. For instance, faucets made from brass are less likely to leak because they resist corrosion and maintain tight tolerances [Source: Michael Litchfield - Renovation, Page 393].
