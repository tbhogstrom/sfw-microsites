## Service Overview

### What is Window Seal Replacement and Reglazing?

Window seal replacement involves removing old, damaged seals around your windows and replacing them with new, high-quality materials. Reglazing refers to the process of replacing or repairing the glass pane and the putty that holds it in place. This process ensures a proper fit and a tight seal around the window frame, preventing air and moisture leaks. Proper installation techniques, such as using self-adhesive flashing tape and siliconized caulk, are essential to create a watertight seal [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation-Taunton Press, Page 140].
