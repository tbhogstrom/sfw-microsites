## Service Overview

### What is Door Threshold Leak Repair?

Door threshold leak repair involves assessing and rectifying issues with the threshold of your door, which serves as a critical barrier against water and air infiltration. This process typically includes the replacement of damaged or outdated thresholds, installation of drainage pans, and application of high-quality sealants, such as silicone caulk, to ensure a watertight seal. According to industry standards, a three-piece threshold system consisting of a sill cover, drain pan, and a gasketed threshold is recommended for optimal performance [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 136].
