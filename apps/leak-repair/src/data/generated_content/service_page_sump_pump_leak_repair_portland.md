1. **Assessment of Existing System**: Evaluation of the sump pump’s components, including the motor, float switch, and discharge pipe.

4. **System Testing**: Ensuring that the sump pump operates correctly post-repair and meets local building codes.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

In Portland, where heavy rainfall is common, the importance of a functioning sump pump cannot be overstated. Local homeowners face unique challenges due to the region's wet climate, which increases the risk of groundwater seepage and flooding. By ensuring your sump pump is in top condition, you protect your home from potential water damage and maintain compliance with local building codes [Source: Wing, Page 479].

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Malfunctioning Float Switch**: A float switch that fails to engage can lead to water overflow in your sump pit, causing leaks [Source: Litchfield, Page 268].
- **Cracked Sump Basin**: Over time, the sump basin can develop cracks that allow water to seep through, necessitating immediate repair [Source: Litchfield, Page 268].
- **Clogged Discharge Lines**: Blockages in the discharge lines can force water back into the sump pit, leading to leaks and system failure [Source: Wing, Page 488].
