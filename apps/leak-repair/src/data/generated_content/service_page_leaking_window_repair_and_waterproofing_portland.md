## Service Overview

### What is Leaking Window Repair and Waterproofing?

Leaking window repair involves identifying and addressing sources of water intrusion around your windows. This includes inspecting the window frame, sealing gaps with high-quality materials, and applying flashing to divert water away from the structure. Key techniques include using self-adhesive flashing tape to create a watertight seal around the window, especially at the sill and jamb edges [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 140; 152].

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's climate is characterized by frequent rain and humidity, making it crucial for homeowners to ensure their windows are properly sealed to prevent water damage. Poorly installed or aging windows can lead to leaks that compromise your home’s structural integrity, create a breeding ground for mold, and increase energy costs due to inefficient insulation. Adhering to local building codes and best practices in waterproofing is essential for long-term home health and safety.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Inadequate Flashing Installation**: Many leaks stem from poor flashing around windows during installation, allowing water to infiltrate [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 140].
- **Old or Damaged Caulking**: Over time, caulking can degrade, leading to gaps that allow water to enter [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 154].
- **Condensation Issues**: Improper sealing can lead to condensation inside the window frames, which may result in rot and mold growth [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 142].
- **Rotting Wood Frames**: If window frames are not properly maintained or sealed, they can rot, leading to structural damage [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 154].
