### What is Window Seal Replacement and Reglazing?

Window seal replacement involves removing old, damaged seals and replacing them with new, high-performance materials. Reglazing, on the other hand, refers to replacing or repairing the glass panes in your windows, ensuring they are properly secured and sealed to prevent drafts and moisture ingress. This process typically involves cleaning the window frame, applying new sealants, and potentially installing new glazing putty or glass.

In executing these services, we utilize techniques such as applying silicone-based caulks around the window frame to ensure a watertight seal [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 140].
