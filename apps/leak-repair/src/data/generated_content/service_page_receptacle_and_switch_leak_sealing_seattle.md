## Service Overview

### What is Receptacle and Switch Leak Sealing?

Receptacle and switch leak sealing involves identifying and sealing any air leaks that may occur around electrical outlets and switches in your home. According to Charlie Wing's "The Visual Handbook of Building and Remodeling," even a small hole around a receptacle can equal a significant energy loss, with an average home containing around 80 receptacles [Source: Visual Handbook, Page 488]. Our service includes installing foam gaskets under cover plates, sealing gaps with caulk, and ensuring that all electrical connections are properly insulated.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

In Seattle, where the climate can be damp and chilly, sealing air leaks is particularly crucial. Homes in this region are often subjected to moisture, which can lead to mold and other air quality issues if not properly managed. By sealing receptacles and switches, you can prevent cold drafts in the winter and help maintain a comfortable indoor environment, all while complying with local building codes.
