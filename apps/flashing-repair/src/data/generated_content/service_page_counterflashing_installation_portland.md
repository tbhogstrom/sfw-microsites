## Service Overview

### What is Counterflashing Installation?

Counterflashing installation involves placing a protective metal flashing at the transition points between a roof and a wall or chimney. This flashing is designed to overlap the base flashing, which is installed beneath the shingles, ensuring that water is directed away from these critical junctions. According to industry standards, counterflashing should extend into the mortar joints of chimneys or walls, effectively sealing the area to prevent water intrusion [Source: (For Pros By Pros) Christina Glennon, Page 186].
