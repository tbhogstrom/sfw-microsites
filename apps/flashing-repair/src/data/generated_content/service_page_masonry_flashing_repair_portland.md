## Service Overview

### What is Masonry Flashing Repair?

Masonry flashing repair involves the inspection, maintenance, and replacement of flashing materials around brick, stone, or stucco structures. Flashing is installed to prevent water penetration at critical points, such as roof-to-wall intersections, chimneys, and windows. A common issue is the failure of this flashing due to improper installation or degradation over time. 

In our process, we follow a detailed approach to ensure the integrity of the flashing, which includes assessing the current condition, meticulously planning the repair, and executing the work using high-quality materials. The installation of counterflashing, which overlaps base flashing, is particularly critical to ensure a watertight seal [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 99].
