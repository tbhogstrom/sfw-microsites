## Service Overview

### What is Counterflashing Repair Services?

Counterflashing repair services involve the inspection, maintenance, and replacement of flashing materials that direct water away from vulnerable areas of your roofing system. Typically, counterflashing consists of a metal barrier that overlaps with base flashing and is integrated into the wall system to protect joints where the roof meets vertical surfaces, such as chimneys or walls. 

In many cases, a two-piece counterflashing system is recommended, allowing for easier removal and maintenance during roof replacements. This method provides a more effective seal against water intrusion and facilitates future repairs [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 186].
