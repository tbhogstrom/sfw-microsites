## Service Overview

### What is Step Flashing Installation and Repair?

Step flashing is a method used to seal the intersection between a roof and a vertical wall or chimney, ensuring that water is directed away from vulnerable areas. It consists of L-shaped pieces of metal flashing that are installed in a step-like fashion, overlapping with the roofing shingles. This technique is crucial for preventing water from seeping under shingles, which can lead to leaks and extensive damage.

Proper installation requires the flashing to be aligned with the top of the shingles and to extend down to the top of the shingle tab, typically around 7 to 8 inches for standard and metric shingles, respectively [Source: Glennon, Page 192]. Incorrectly placed or sized flashing can create gaps that allow water to penetrate, thus necessitating timely repairs or replacements.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's maritime climate, characterized by frequent rain and humidity, makes effective step flashing installation vital. The city's building codes emphasize the need for proper waterproofing in roofing systems to combat potential water damage. Many homes in Seattle are susceptible to leaks if the flashing is improperly installed or maintained. Our service not only adheres to these codes but also addresses the specific challenges posed by the local environment.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Improperly Installed Flashing**: Incorrectly positioned flashing can lift shingles, allowing water to enter [Source: Glennon, Page 192].
- **Misplaced or Undersized Flashing**: Flashing that does not extend adequately can create gaps prone to leaks [Source: Glennon, Page 192].
- **Wear and Tear**: Aging flashing can corrode or become ineffective, leading to water intrusion [Source: Wing, Page 279].
- **Poor Sealing**: Inadequate sealing at the joints can allow moisture to penetrate, causing mold and structural damage [Source: Litchfield, Page 162].
