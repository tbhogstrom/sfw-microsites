## Service Overview

### What is Flashing Maintenance and Inspection Services?

Flashing maintenance and inspection services involve a comprehensive evaluation of all flashing components in your roofing and siding systems. This includes visual inspections, assessing the integrity of materials, and checking for proper installation techniques. For instance, step flashing must be correctly positioned and overlap appropriately to prevent water from seeping underneath shingles and causing damage [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 192]. Our team checks for the following:

- **Correct Placement**: Ensuring flashing is aligned with shingles and properly overlaps to prevent leaks.
- **Material Assessment**: Evaluating the condition of materials like aluminum or copper flashing, where copper is often preferred for its durability [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 194].
- **Sealant Integrity**: Inspecting areas around windows, doors, and chimneys for any signs of wear or failure.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Seattle, Washington

Seattle's unique climate, characterized by high humidity and frequent rain, increases the risk of water damage if flashing is not properly maintained. The Pacific Northwest is prone to moss growth and organic material buildup, which can further compromise flashing systems if left unchecked. Adhering to local building codes and ensuring your flashing is compliant can save you from future headaches and expenses.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Improperly Installed Flashing**: Incorrect installation can lead to leaks, as highlighted by the need to replace misaligned step flashing [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 192].
- **Material Degradation**: Flashing materials can corrode over time, requiring replacement or repairs to prevent water ingress [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 194].
- **Blocked Weep Holes**: Weep holes in brick and masonry walls are essential for drainage. If blocked, water can accumulate and cause structural damage [Source: Charlie Wing, Page 75].
- **Gaps in Valley Flashing**: Open valleys without proper flashing or waterproof membranes can lead to significant leaks, necessitating complete reroofing if not addressed early [Source: Christina Glennon, Page 188].
