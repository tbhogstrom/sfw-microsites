## 2. Service Overview

### What is Pressure-Treated Wood Installation?

Pressure-treated wood is lumber that has been infused with protective chemicals to enhance its resistance to decay and insect damage. This process involves forcing preservatives into the wood, making it nearly immune to rot [Source: Charlie Wing - The Visual Handbook of Building and Remodeling, Page 126]. 

### Why is it Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon?

Given Portland's rainy climate, using pressure-treated wood is crucial for homeowners looking to build durable structures that can withstand moisture. Traditional wood products may deteriorate quickly when exposed to the elements, leading to costly repairs or replacements. Pressure-treated wood provides the needed durability, ensuring that your investment lasts longer and performs better in wet conditions.

### Common Problems This Service Solves

- **Decay and Rot:** Standard wood can rot when exposed to moisture. Pressure-treated wood combats this issue effectively.
- **Insect Damage:** Wood-boring insects, such as termites, can compromise structural integrity. Our treated wood prevents infestations.
- **Weathering:** Pressure treatment protects against the harmful effects of UV rays and moisture, maintaining appearance and function for years to come.
