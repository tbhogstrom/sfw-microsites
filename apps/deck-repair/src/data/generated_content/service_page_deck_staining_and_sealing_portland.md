## 2. Service Overview

### What is Deck Staining and Sealing?

Deck Staining and Sealing involves the application of specially formulated stains and sealants to wooden decks to enhance their durability and appearance. This process not only beautifies your outdoor space but also serves as a protective barrier against moisture, UV rays, and other environmental factors.

### Why It's Important for Homeowners in Portland, Oregon

Portland's unique climate, characterized by its wet winters and sunny summers, can take a toll on unprotected wooden structures. The constant fluctuation in weather can lead to problems such as wood rot, warping, and fading. By investing in deck staining and sealing, homeowners can effectively safeguard their decks against these issues.

### Common Problems This Service Solves
- **Moisture Damage:** Water can penetrate wood, leading to rot and structural failure. Sealants help to repel moisture [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 580].
- **UV Damage:** Sun exposure can cause fading and deterioration. Quality stains contain UV blockers to maintain color and integrity [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 540].
- **Mold and Mildew Growth:** Portland’s humidity can encourage mold growth. Proper sealing prevents moisture buildup, reducing the risk of mold [Source: Michael Litchfield, Renovation, Page 541].
