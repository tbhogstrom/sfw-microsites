## Our Process
### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. Initial Assessment
We begin with a thorough evaluation of the damaged areas to determine the extent of decay and the appropriate repair methods. This step is crucial for ensuring a tailored approach to each project.

#### 2. Planning & Preparation
Once the assessment is complete, we develop a detailed plan that outlines the necessary steps for repair. This includes selecting the right materials and preparing the work area by cleaning and removing any loose debris.

#### 3. Execution
The execution phase involves applying a liquid consolidant to the damaged areas to stabilize the wood. According to best practices, small punctures are made to allow for deep penetration of the consolidant [Source: Litchfield, Page 247]. After allowing it to cure, we mix the two-part epoxy filler to a peanut butter-like consistency for application to the affected areas [Source: Glennon, Page 198].

#### 4. Quality Check & Cleanup
Post-application, we conduct a quality check to ensure the epoxy has cured correctly and has formed a solid bond with the wood. We then clean the work area and prepare it for the finishing touches.

#### 5. Follow-up
To ensure complete satisfaction, we schedule a follow-up visit to address any concerns and to verify the longevity of the repairs.
